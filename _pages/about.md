`Software Development` is what I used to pursue and was happy :smile: with my normal development cycle until I got introduced to `Deep Learning`. Now my project life-cycle is a stream of things that doesn't-work doesn't-work doesn't-work until it eventually does :disappointed_relieved: . So my goal is to bring that rewarding cycle of Software Development to Deep Learning tasks. Particularly interested in High Level APIs that makes life easier and deep learning accessible to everyone.
